The bar chart below shows the NSW COVID-19 cases by age group.

This bar chart claims that the most COVID-19 patients are concentrated in adolescents aged 0-19 in NSW. 

It may emphasise that teenagers prefer to play or study together. They may not willing to follow their parent's teachings, and they donâ€™t like staying at home. 

As a result, they may become the main contagious. However, they have had better resistance due to a healthy body.

```{r age group, echo=FALSE}
age%>%
  group_by(age_group)%>%
  summarise(COVID_19_Cases = (count=n()))%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(y = age_group, x = COVID_19_Cases), fill = hue_pal()(4)[1], width = 0.6)+
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases by Age Group") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = 'bold'))
```

Tips! If you are a resident of NSW, please monitor your children at some special time, they may cause serious consequences.
